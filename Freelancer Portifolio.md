## **Selected Projects & Experience**

### **AI-Based Duplicate Payment & Fraud Detection Platform**

**Problem**  
Large ERP systems process high volumes of financial transactions, making them vulnerable to duplicate payments, fraud, and costly manual audits. Existing controls were largely reactive and rule-based, leading to false positives and delayed detection.

**Solution**  
Designed and built an AI-driven duplicate payment and fraud detection platform using Python and supervised machine learning models (Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier). The solution analyzed historical ERP payment data, vendor behavior, invoice patterns, and timing anomalies to proactively identify high-risk transactions.

**Architecture Highlights**

* ERP data ingestion via databases and APIs  
* Feature engineering and model training in Python  
* Scoring engine to flag suspicious transactions  
* Dashboards and reports for audit and finance teams

**Impact**

* Proactively identified performance degradation before outages occurred  
* Improved user experience by preventing slowdowns and system downtime  
* Achieved approximately 20% more accurate performance predictions compared to baseline methods

**AWS Architecture Bridge**  
This solution can be implemented on AWS using CloudWatch and custom metrics for data collection, Amazon S3 for historical data storage, AWS Lambda or ECS for forecasting jobs, and Amazon SageMaker for time-series modeling. Dashboards and alerts can be delivered via CloudWatch, Grafana, or Amazon QuickSight.

## **AIOps & Intelligent Monitoring Experience**

### **AI-Driven Operations & Observability**

I apply AIOps principles to improve system reliability, reduce noise, and enable proactive operations across cloud and enterprise environments. By combining monitoring data, logs, and historical trends with machine learning models, I help teams move from reactive incident response to predictive and automated operations.

**Key Capabilities**

* Anomaly detection on performance, traffic, and financial metrics  
* Noise reduction and alert correlation using data-driven techniques  
* Root cause analysis support through pattern recognition  
* Predictive capacity and performance forecasting

**Technologies & Approaches**

* Python-based data pipelines for metrics and logs  
* Time-series analysis (ARIMA) for trend forecasting  
* Supervised learning for classification and risk scoring  
* Integration with monitoring platforms (CloudWatch, Prometheus, ELK, Grafana)

**AWS AIOps Architecture Examples**

* CloudWatch metrics and logs streamed to S3 for historical analysis  
* AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS for model execution and automation  
* Amazon SageMaker for training and hosting ML models  
* Event-driven remediation workflows using EventBridge

## **How I Apply AIOps**

1. **Discover & Baseline**  
   Review existing architecture, monitoring, logs, and alerts to understand current behavior and pain points.  
2. **Model & Detect**  
   Apply statistical and machine learning models to identify anomalies, trends, and early warning signals.  
3. **Correlate & Explain**  
   Correlate metrics, logs, and events to reduce noise and support faster root cause analysis.  
4. **Automate & Improve**  
   Implement alerts, dashboards, and optional automation to prevent incidents and continuously improve reliability.
